              I’ve recently launched this website as a space to share more about
              myself, blending my personal interests with my professional
              experiences. Outside of work, I have a deep interest in Arabic
              calligraphy and experience in graphic design. These creative
              outlets allow me to explore different forms of visual expression
              and storytelling, adding depth to my creative approach. I also
              enjoy staying active through soccer and scuba diving, keeping a
              healthy balance between work and play.

              I’m Amar Algogandi, a UX designer and researcher dedicated to
              creating user-centered experiences that are intuitive and
              functional. My focus is on understanding user needs and applying
              that knowledge to design digital solutions that not only work well
              but also enhance the user experience. With my background in
              graphic design, I blend aesthetics with functionality to ensure
              that every interface is visually appealing and user-friendly. I
              enjoy the process of bringing creativity and practical solutions
              together to solve real-world problems through design.
